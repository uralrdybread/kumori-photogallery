# Kumoricon Share Gallery
Kumoricon is a portland based anime convention that I do volunteer developer work for. This is a proposed change to the current Kumoricon photo gallery.

## Photo Gallery with Filter and Social Media Sharing
This project features a beautiful photo gallery with an intuitive filter that enables users to search for photos by year or view all photos at once. When a user selects a specific year, the photos align neatly and uniformly using flexbox.

To view a full-size photo, users can click on the desired image, which will bring up an enlarged window. In this window, users have the option to share the photo on any of the three social media platforms provided. Clicking on the share buttons redirects users to the chosen platform with the photo address pre-populated in a new post.

To enhance engagement and increase discussion about the convention, social media sharing buttons were added. The Twitter button uses Twitter's own "intent" API, while the Facebook button uses Facebook's "sharer" API. Both APIs copy the image address and place it into a new post, allowing users to add comments and share it with their followers and friends.

## Future Plans
This is a proposed change to the website and is subject to change depending on the wants or needs of Kumoricon management.
